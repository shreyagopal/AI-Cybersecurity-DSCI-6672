# AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repo contains all the programming lab assignments from course AI & Cybersecurity. *The datasets used in the Jupyter notebooks are available in the Data Files folder of this repo.*


## Assignments:

* [Perceptron for Phish Detection](https://github.com/shreyagopal/AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672/blob/master/Perceptron_for_Phish_Detection.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shreyagopal/AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672/blob/master/Perceptron_for_Phish_Detection.ipynb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is Perceptron??** A perceptron is a machine learning algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. Hyperparameters in the moel are tunned to acheive better performance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Dataset Details:** The dataset used in Perceptron for Phish Detection Jupyter Notebook is extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Phishing Websites Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites). 

* [Logistic Regression for SMS Spam Classification](https://github.com/shreyagopal/AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20for%20Spam%20Classification.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shreyagopal/AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20for%20Spam%20Classification.ipynb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is Logistic Regression??** Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). Hyperparameters in the model are tunned to achieve better performance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Dataset Details:** The dataset used in Logistic Regression for Spam Classification Jupyter Notebook is a refined dataset of [SMS Spam Collection Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection), extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* [SVM for Phish Detection](https://github.com/shreyagopal/AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672/blob/master/3.%20SVM%20for%20Phish%20Detection.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shreyagopal/AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672/blob/master/3.%20SVM%20for%20Phish%20Detection.ipynb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What are SVMs??** In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. Hyperparameters in the model are tunned to achieve better performance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Dataset Details:** The dataset used in SVM for Phish Detection Jupyter Notebook is extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Phishing Websites Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites).
