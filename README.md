## Assignments:

* [Perceptron for Phish Detection](https://github.com/shreyagopal/AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672/blob/master/Perceptron_for_Phish_Detection.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shreyagopal/AI-Cybersecurity-DSCI-6672/blob/master/Perceptron_for_Phish_Detection.ipynb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Jupyter notebook covers the workflow of training a single-layer perceptron model to create a phish detector. The step by step process involves reading data from CSV file, creating samples and target datasets, splitting the data to train and test datasets, importing and using [Perceptron model from sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron.html), fitting the model with tain dataset, predicting the target values of test dataset and caluclating the preformance of the model. Hyperparameters are tunned to acheive better performance.
